My husband and I are originally from Southern California, where we visit often to spend time with our families. We love Northnern California and we enjoy reading, traveling and photography together. My dream is to one day work towards environmental sustainability using technology. I can't wait to get involved in technology spanning anywhere from water quality test equitment to electric cars.
